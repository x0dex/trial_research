Here are the common occurnces in each of these occurences:
  - In each case, I was homeless for a prolonged period of time thus easier to take advantage of
  - In each case, here was no actual legal violation
  - In the RI case and this case, I was followed for great distances
  - In two cases hospitals were involved
  - In two cases, security officers acted outside of their scope of their
      duties and assaulted me (restraints, obstructing my path physically)
  - In every case, malicious information transmitted about me would have to be proactive.
      Many tourists crowd Taylor Swift's home, why was I singled out more than a mile
        away from her home walking the other direction?
      If the individuals at the hospital were truly thinking of my safety, why 
        wouldn't anyone simply give me a wheelchair?
      Why were the security guards intent on causing me more phsyical harm,
        in a hospital where people are supposed to be cared for?
      In all cases, if any real information about my behavior was negative,
        then it definetely wasn't illegal, and it must have been magnified.
  
  The three scenarios listed aren't the only scenarios. In totem, I've been charged
    with 13 crimes that I didn't commit. Of those 13 crimes, only two were found guilty.
    One where the attorney essentially forced me to sign a plea deal, and the other would
    have been dropped if I went to trial, but I accepted a plea down to Tresspassing. 
    (I was initially charged with Burglary for having my backpack found in a hotel in Nashville).

  In all these cases, my perception is that a malicious person, or party, goes unhindered in
    ruining my life. This case of tresspassing is no different to me in my mind. Perhaps the 
    person is an informant or is a federal agent whose jurisdiction isn't restricted to 
    state boundaries

  In Miami alone, I have been accused of crimes that I'm not remotely capable of. When asking
    for assistance from the VA, a written accusation an obscure event from 4 years ago in a 
    different state was brought up. This document has never prevented me from receiving care
    at any VA, yet here in Miami, every social worker has told me that it applies nation-wide
    which excludes me from the majority of homeless services available to homeless combat veterans.
    So then, I have to suspect that the slander has gone even to the point of forcing me
    to continue to live as a homeless person; possibly to be easier to exploit.
