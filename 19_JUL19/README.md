The most famous of these charges also occured when I was homeless. 

On 7/19/2019, I was arrested in Westerly, RI for possession of Burglary Tools, RI 11-8-7, and 
possession of weapons other than a firearm, RI 11-47-42(a) with the pulicized intent of using
those tools to gain access to or in some way harm the celebrity known as Taylor Swift. Apparantly
this person has a home in the area.

I did, in-fact, have lock picks. I was attending a security conference in Las Vegas called DEF CON.
DEF CON is widely known amongst hackers as the biggest hacker conference of the year. My first 
conference was Circle City Con in Indianapolis, IN, where a 'security professionals' introduced
me to their community. Matt Brenton, Zach Zaffis, Brandon Murphy are some of the individuals who invited me. 
In fact Brandon gave me his black bagde to where just so I could attend the conference. I was going to a 
regular hacker meet-up called hack manhattan, https://hackmanhattan.com/ and had just attended supercon, 
a hacker conference that meets in Brooklyn summer of 2019. Also, this is where someone suggested to 
me something concerning Taylor swift (CCC 5/2018). I had no interest at all previous to this.

Toool, a physical security (locks, doors, building access, etc.) had offered to pay for my hotel room at
DEF CON if I would be willing to volunteer to teach basic physical security. Despite being homeless,
I had enough money to go to Las Vegas. The conference, at this point, was three weeks away, I was more
familiar with the NY area and remained there. I had recently been jumped in NY, (In fact in Times Squaure) 
suffering broken ribs, so I bought a baseball bat, which accounts for the other weapon.

I perceived that my current situation was engineered by malicious hackers and thought that if I were to
meet a friend at this conference, I'd cease to be homeless and my friends would help me to recover; that
they might be able to shine some light on why this happened (prolonged homelessness), and protect me
from whoever it was.

The events of this event are as follows:
I had spent much of the day, 7/19, on the beach, and began planning for sundown. I planned to 
go back to downtown Westerly to a hotel, then at some point the next week, possibly the next day,
fly or bus to Las Vegas. 1.5 miles away from the beach, which is where the celebrities home is 
supposed to be, I was arrested. 

At this point I had done nothing illegal. I had demonstrated nothing to anyone of any illegal intent
to anyone and especially not a celebrity. In the days that followed, I was nationally humiliated in
public and national news.

The charges were subsequently dropped.
